# Expense-Tracker
📚 Course Project Showcase: Personal Expense Tracker 💸
As part of our 1st Semester coursework for the subject “Python for Engineers”, my classmates and I collaborated to build a Personal Expense Tracker — a web-based app designed to help users manage their daily spending.

This academic project gave us hands-on experience implementing core Python programming and web development concepts in a practical and meaningful way.

🔍 Why We Built This:
We wanted a simple yet useful tool to monitor expenses and learn how Flask works for full-stack web applications. It became a stepping stone to understanding backend development, data flow, and user interactions — crucial skills for modern developers.

💡 What We Built:
• A functional CRUD application using Flask
• Category-based expense tracking (e.g., Food, Travel, Education)
• Clean, responsive UI with Bootstrap
• JSON file-based data storage system

🧠 Key Learnings:
✔ Applied Python OOP in real-world logic
✔ Understood Flask routing, templating, and form handling
✔ Learned to collaborate and integrate code as a team
✔ Emphasized user input validation and experience design

📅 We also presented this project during our Course Project (CP) Review on 10th Feb 2025.

🎓 This project not only helped us build something valuable from scratch but also deepened our understanding of Python’s practical uses beyond basic scripts.
